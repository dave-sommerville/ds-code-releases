# The Dungeons of Draegmor - Beta Release
Welcome to my Dungeon, Adventurer! 

One somewhat ambiguous line in a college assignment drove me to develop an exploration system for a dungeon crawler. I returned to the assignment and it's... gotten a little out of hand. 


A console, text based, dungeon crawler written in c#, this game presents a randomly generated, sandbox style exploration game including combat, NPCs, rewards, traps, and magical items. 

This game's brain can handle many different possible outcomes and it's diffcult for a single developer to propery find and fix bugs. It's even more difficult for me to establish good parameters for balancing challenge and reward. This is why I invite you to this adventure. 

There is a playtest workbook available in both the [Adventurer's Pack](https://dave-sommerville.github.io/ds-code-releases/Releases/dungeon-adventurers-pack.zip) and my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/dave-sommerville/Dungeon_Crawler)

I welcome all feedback if you don't want to complete the workbook, but structured data is most helpful to me.

As extensive as this program currently is, this is only the first step. An expansion is already in development and you might see signs of it in the current version. Once I can be sure bugs and balancing are under control, updates on the final version will be available. 


I'm pleased with the game play I've achieved, but what I'm most proud of in this project is the script itself. If you are a programmer, I would love your opinion on my code and design behind the scenes: full code available [here](https://github.com/dave-sommerville/Dungeon_Crawler) I didn't include the code as part of the feedback form, so feel free to reach out to me via email or on my personal website [DS Code](https://ds-code.ca)
